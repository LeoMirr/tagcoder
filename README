mp3 tag's text encoder/decoder
by me aka Leo Mirr oslagy@gmail.com

Sometimes i encounter that mp3 file have tags in different encodings and
sometimes there is many of such files. So i decide to write a program that
draw all tags of all files and allows to change encoding independently for
every field.

Note: there is some exemple mp3 files with tiny size.
Note: each gui element has tooltip
